# PetSitting-api

This repository will serve as API for the pet sitting app we are making. We can use this file to communicate with eachother.

Questions:
<<<<<<< HEAD

  1. AdvertModel, why do we need activated? how does that work?
  2. Should userId in advertModel & username in userModel be the same?
  3. BirthDate (both in petModel & userModel) is a string? Is there a reason we don't make it type: date?
  
  
  Further questions:
  - How do we us tabPet?
  - How can the online/offline work? it is not something the user can type in right? how does this work in this model?
  - Do we have to modify the back, to have the password view as °°°°° instead of MYPASSWORD ?
=======
  1. Model/Show: make this advert -> DONE
  2. Model/booking: can we make this the user? -> NO BUT USER CREATED
  3. Delete Model/booking
  4. Create Model/pet

Should the userId in the advert model be the same as the username in the user model?
